Things to ask the prof

Testbench simulation doesn't do what is supposed to do (output and halting at 250us), (how to load testbench sdram data?)

script mul32.do can't find some signals and the result is undefined

multiplication is a "*" how can we improve it? In configuration script we can select 2cycles multiplier but it seems to do nothing, is that the way?

Is vivado ok for synthesis?

Mul32: in documentation it says signed but it seems to work in 2's complement SOLVED: in documentation says that 32nd bit is sign 31..0 is 2's complement (so op1[32] == op1[31])

command "make ise-map" return error!!!!! (Invalid target device 'xc4vfx60') and in the  environment can't find leon3mp.prj
