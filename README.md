The goal of this project is to improve the LEON3 core performance. To evaluate the new core we relied on a set of benchmarks: Dhrystone, Stanford, Whetstone, GMPbench, and MiBench suites, and a VIRTEX4 ML410 FPGA board. As a start point for this project we used the grlib-gpl-1.1.0-b4104.zip archive (provided by the course instructors but also available online). To improve the performance we rewrote the Multiplier and Divider implementations.

This project was done for TU Delft course: Processor Design Project (ET4171).
The contributors are Henrique Dantas and Luca Feltrin.
