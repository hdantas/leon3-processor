The following VHDL files should go in /home/nuno/repos/pdp/grlib-gpl-1.1.0-b4104/lib/gaisler/arith.
Don't forget to compile them to the gaisler library and not to the default work.

t3to2compressor.vhd
qSelector.vhd
div32.vhd

FA.vhd
HA.vhd
mul32.vhd

Finally please use make xconfig to configure the multiplier to 2-cycle.
