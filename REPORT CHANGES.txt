*************************DONE******************************
In the introduction you should include a short summary of the entire work:
- motivation for your approach: what is the general idea behind your optimization proposal, how have you decided to make the changes to the core, and why those and no other changes;
- what are the changes that you have performed to the core, together with their implications;
***************************************************

		- results;
		- what is your conclusion.

*************************DONE**************************************************
At the end of the introduction add also the organization (outline) of the report.

Section 2 should look more like a motivation - much more descriptive and detailed than what you said in the introduction. I assume that this is what you intended it to be, but it looks a bit out of the context (there is no introduction to it), it is very short and not conclusive. Detail:
- how did you analyze the baseline processor in order to discover its weak points (did you scan also the benchmarks?);
- what were your findings based on which you have decided to make your improvements;
- what do you expect from implementing those changes. Update also the title.

In sections 3 and 4 you did not motivate well enough your choices for the multiplier/divider. Make a survey of different possibilities and give reasons for your choices. Refer to some published work. Also, it is not clear how did you verify your new multiplier/divider? What kind of test-benches did you make? What were their coverage?

Please describe the action of each handshaking signal between your multiplier/divider and the other part of Leon3 processor in the form of a state machine or timing diagram, accordingly.

In section 5 your baseline numbers are not the right ones - it may be that you didn't update the values from the newest result file from blackboard, or that you synthesized your own baseline design with DSPs and used those numbers. Next, it is not clear if your design works at 80 MHz or at 40 MHz. It is also difficult to track the differences if you have two tables - 5.1 and 5.2. Make just one table as the headers are the same. This holds for the benchmarks tables as well. Regarding the metrics comparison, again, why did you use the equivalent 40MHz frequency delay and not the 80 MHz one? 

*****************************DONE*************************
Please describe and argue the formula for metric A.

It would be good to synthesize separately three designs: (i) one with an improved multiplier, (ii) one with an improved divider, and (iii), one with an improved multiplier and an improved divider. In this manner you will be able to see the impact of each improvement separately and compare them better in terms of area/delay/power metrics as well as in terms of the compound metrics. In the end, analyze the results that you obtained for the various benchmarks. What is the difference between them? Why is that you get better improvements for some benchmarks, while less for others? What is the difference between the results for synthetic benchmarks and the results for real benchmarks?

In the introduction you state that: "Our main target is to decrease the computation time for certain benchmarks keeping the power consumption as low as possible, thus for us the most relevant compound metric is the power×benchmark score (P×BS)." Did you manage to do that? It is not clear from the report that it was improved, since the difference is 1%. Moreover, did you considered any special changes in the implementations, or any subset of benchmarks to address the power-performance trade-off?

Refine also the conclusions and include a summary of your work. You should also put things into prospective and include the following:
- what was your initial plan;
- what were your expectations;
- what are the results and why are the results not according to the expectations in case they are not.

Conclusions can also include some feedback to help us to improve the project for the next generations (not mandatory but it is more than welcome).

The figures are not descriptive enough. Make more figures to present the multiplier and the divider. Start from the top level and then go inside and present each important component, i.e., component that you have implemented in a special manner, in such a way that it is clear where it is placed and why.

Your report should have a clear flow from the beginning to the end. Sections should nicely and logically follow each other, with links to the next ones.
