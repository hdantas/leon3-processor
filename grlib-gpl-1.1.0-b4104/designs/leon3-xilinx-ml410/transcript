# LOG(3)                     Linux Programmer's Manual                    LOG(3)
# 
# 
# 
# NAME
#        log, logf, logl - natural logarithmic function
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        #include <math.h>
# 
#        double log(double x);
#        float logf(float x);
#        long double logl(long double x);
# 
#        Link with -lm.
# 
#    Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):
# 
#        logf(), logl():
#            _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600 ||
#            _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L;
#            or cc -std=c99
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The log() function returns the natural logarithm of x.
# 
# RETURN VALUE
#        On success, these functions return the natural logarithm of x.
# 
#        If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.
# 
#        If x is 1, the result is +0.
# 
#        If x is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.
# 
#        If x is zero, then a  pole  error  occurs,  and  the  functions  return
#        -HUGE_VAL, -HUGE_VALF, or -HUGE_VALL, respectively.
# 
#        If  x  is  negative  (including negative infinity), then a domain error
#        occurs, and a NaN (not a number) is returned.
# 
# ERRORS
#        See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an  error
#        has occurred when calling these functions.
# 
#        The following errors can occur:
# 
#        Domain error: x is negative
#               errno  is  set  to  EDOM.   An  invalid floating-point exception
#               (FE_INVALID) is raised.
# 
#        Pole error: x is zero
#               errno is set to ERANGE.  A divide-by-zero floating-point  excep‐
#               tion (FE_DIVBYZERO) is raised.
# 
# CONFORMING TO
#        C99, POSIX.1-2001.  The variant returning double also conforms to SVr4,
#        4.3BSD, C89.
# 
# BUGS
#        In glibc 2.5 and earlier, taking the log() of a NaN  produces  a  bogus
#        invalid floating-point (FE_INVALID) exception.
